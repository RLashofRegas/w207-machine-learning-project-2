Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

        "\n",
        "   a.   The main reason nearest neighbors does not work well is because of the large volume and variation of common words used throughout the documents. This causes an given document to match other documents that share a similar corpus of common words rather than taking into account the less common words which likely have more relevance to the meaning of the document. This is especially true due to the high frequency of common words in a given document compared to 1 or 2 instances of words that may better align with other documents of the same category.\n",

        "2.   Any ideas why logistic regression doesn't work as well as Naive Bayes?\n",
        "\n",
        "   b.   There are a couple of reasons why I think Naive Bayes works better for this problem than Logistic Regression. Firstly, Logistic Regression tends to not perform as well with sparse data because it becomes hard to converge on the best parameter values. Related to this, Naive Bayes on the other hand treats each feature independently allowing words that only appear in a given class in the training data to have a much higher impact than in Logistic Regression where you are trying to fit all coefficients together as a single model.\n",
        "   \n",
        "3.   As we can see above the sum of squared coefficients for a given class increase as we increase the C parameter. This is because C is the inverse of the regularization strength, $\\lambda$. This means that as C increases, the regularization strength decreases which reduces the penalty of having large coefficients and therefore allows the sum of squared weights to be higher."

That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",
